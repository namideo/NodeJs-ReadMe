  ## Description 
  The purpose of this exercise is to create a README generator. As with any project it is essential to have a high quality README that explains the purpose of your app and how it functions as well as instructions for installation, a simulation that demontrates its usefulness, and a section where other developers can make contributions. What follows is a command-line application that generates a professional README.md file through the use of Node.js
      
  ## Installation 
  In order to install this application, go to the repository and clone it into your terminal. Next, you must run "npm init -y" and "npm install" in the termianl in order to install the necessary dependencies in the package.json.
  
  ## Usage

  This appliation uses inquirer to collect user input and fs.writeFile to generate the README file. 
  
  First run "node index" in the command line and you will be prompted with a series of questions for criteria. Once all the questions have been answered the file will be generated.
  
  ## Contributing 
  For anyone looking to contribute to the functionality of the application, you would just need to clone it into a new branch, and then after making changes push it back up through GitHub in the form of a merge request. 
  
  ## Test 
  Developing this application was a constant trial and error. The main struggle I had was writing the function to generate the README file. After that it was a matter of getting the information to display the way it needed to be.
